Numerical Integration Using Simpson 3/8 Method Algorithm
In numerical analysis, Simpson's 3/8 rule (method) is a technique for approximating definite integral of a continuous function.

This method is based on Newton's Cote Quadrature Formula and Simpson 3/8 rule is obtained when we put value of n = 3 in this formula.

In this article, we are going to develop an algorithm for Simpson 3/8 Rule.

Simpson's 3/8 Rule Algorithm
1. Start

2. Define function f(x)

3. Read lower limit of integration, upper limit of 
   integration and number of sub interval

4. Calcultae: step size = (upper limit - lower limit)/number of sub interval

5. Set: integration value = f(lower limit) + f(upper limit)

6. Set: i = 1

7. If i > number of sub interval then goto 

8. Calculate: k = lower limit + i * h

9. If i mod 3 =0 then 
     Integration value = Integration Value + 2* f(k)
   Otherwise
     Integration Value = Integration Value + 3 * f(k)
   End If

10. Increment i by 1 i.e. i = i+1 and go to step 7

11. Calculate: Integration value = Integration value * step size*3/8 

12. Display Integration value as required answer

13. Stop
