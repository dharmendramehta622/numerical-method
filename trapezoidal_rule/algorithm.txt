Numerical Integration Using Trapezoidal Method Algorithm
In numerical analysis, Trapezoidal method is a technique for evaluating definite integral. This method is also known as Trapezoidal rule or Trapezium rule.

This method is based on Newton's Cote Quadrature Formula and Trapezoidal rule is obtained when we put value of n = 1 in this formula.

In this article, we are going to develop an algorithm for Trapezoidal method.

Trapezoidal Method Algorithm
1. Start

2. Define function f(x)

3. Read lower limit of integration, upper limit of 
   integration and number of sub interval

4. Calcultae: step size = (upper limit - lower limit)/number of sub interval

5. Set: integration value = f(lower limit) + f(upper limit)

6. Set: i = 1

7. If i > number of sub interval then goto 

8. Calculate: k = lower limit + i * h

9. Calculate: Integration value = Integration Value + 2* f(k)

10. Increment i by 1 i.e. i = i+1 and go to step 7

11. Calculate: Integration value = Integration value * step size/2 

12. Display Integration value as required answer

13. Stop
